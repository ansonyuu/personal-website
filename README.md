# Personal Site ðŸŒ³

Check it out [here!](ansonyu.ca) 

## What's this?

My personal site, made entirely from scratch! This website is a hub to me to share details about my ongoing projects, curiosities, and musings. It contains the following pages:
* About - A general home page
* Projects - A more detailed reports on my initiatives
* Journal - A online diary of sorts
* Photos - A gallery of some of my favorite shots
* Jokes - Anything that makes me laugh/chortle

## Why this?

Rather than using a website builder or pre-made theme, I wanted the flexibility to customize the site to my heart's desires. On top of the endless possiblities, I was also able to learn a lot about web dev along the way.

## What's next?

To finish populating the rest of the pages! After filling in the content itself, I'm looking to optimize the site to be 100% accessible for people of all abilities. Last but not least, a couple of effects on scroll could also be interesting.
