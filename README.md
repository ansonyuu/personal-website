# Personal Site ðŸŒ³

Check it out [here!](ansonyu.ca) 

## What's this?

My personal site, made entirely from scratch! This website is a hub to me to share details about my ongoing projects, curiosities, and musings. It contains the following pages:
* About
* Projects
* Journal
* Photos
* Jokes

## Why this?

Rather than using a website builder or pre-made theme, I wanted the flexibility to customize the site to my heart's desires. On top of the endless possiblities, I was also able to learn a lot about web dev along the way.

## What's next?

To finish up the rest of the pages! Excited to keep populating each page as I go along.
